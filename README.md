# UnderstandingJS

## What you will learn
1. <b>Get started!</b> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yJOh9epyYqIpLIX9s292aCeffoMM9vtiJ_BDOnLVJMI">Slide</a>): This part would let everyone review their knowledges about JS, help them understand more how JS engine compile and runs their code, which leads to the understanding of scoping, hoisting, scope chaining, global object, the creation of this keyword,… These terms are important, they need to understand these carefully so later on, they won’t lose themself with other concepts/features, some weird parts of JS.
    - Overview JS fundamentals (declaration, types, loops, conditons,...)
    - How JS is compiled and running.
    - Execution context, how this keyword is created.
    - Scopes, hoisting, scope chain, global object.
    <br>
2. <b>Objects and Functions</b>: This part would let everyone understand more about the most important aspect of JS, learn/understand more about this and know exactly where it points to and how to manipulate it,...
    - Go deep into JS Functions and Objects
    - Callbacks, closure
    - IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression)
    - How this works
3. <b>Practical ES6, ES7 features and TypeScript</b>: This part would let everyone learn more about ES6/ES7 features and learn more about the advantages/benefits for using those, also introduce a bit about TS and some basic syntax
    - Introduce ES6, ES7
    - Promise, asynchronous events deep dive
    - Reason to use compare to older JS syntax/features
    - Introduce basic TypeScript syntax
4. <b>Code quality</b>: Learn how to detect bad codes in JS, how to improve it and learn how to use ESlint to detect bad codes and fix it automatically,… Learn more about functional programming and the “how” and the “why” JS suits for that coding technique
    - Detect bad codes and how to improve
    - Learn some best practices, apply popular rules from
    - Google or Airbnb with ESlint + prettier
    - Functional programing
5. <b>Practice - Automation test with Element</b>: Or we can build together an basic automation test framework with JavaScript/TypeScript, maybe use Cypress/puppeteer/playwright/selenium,…

### How to submit your work
Assume that you are all familiar with <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git">Git</a>. Please follow these steps to submit your work:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create new branch from `master` and name your branch following this convention `assignment/<KMS ID>-<Your Name>`, Ex: assignment/1373-Hoang
3. Do your exercises in your branch.
Create `.js` file for each exercise with following convention `ex<exercise number>.js`, Ex: ex1.js, ex2.js. Then place them inside each the section folder.
4. When done, commit and push all content to your branch remotely.
5. Create a Merge Request that based on `master`.

## Documentations & Practice
If you want to take a real deep into JavaScript world, these documentations might be useful for you:

- <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/README.md">You don't know JS</a>: by Kyle Simpson, this is a series of books diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript language.
